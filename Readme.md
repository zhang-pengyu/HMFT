Code for Hierarchical Multi-modal Fusion Tracker in CVPR2022 paper [Visible-Thermal UAV Tracking: A Large-Scale Benchmark and New Baseline](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.04120.pdf), which is a strong baseline for RGB-T tracking.

## Framework
![alt text](https://github.com/zhang-pengyu/HMFT/blob/master/framework.png)
*Three complementary modules are introduced for multi-modal fusion*
 * **Complementary Image Fusion(CIF)**: CIF aims to use a shared backbone to extract complementary information and Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence loss is introduced to unify the feature distribution.
 * **Discriminative Feature Fusion(DFF)**: DFF aims to build individual representations for both modalities and learns a channel-wise modality weight to fuse them.
 * **Adaptive Decision Fusion(ADF)**: ADF is to adaptively provide the final response by considering the results of two branches and the modality confidence.
